# FX-Imbalance-Dashboard
This Plotly Dashboard explores how growth in M2 Money Supply might be affecting GBP/USD currency exchange rate (CABLE). Find the link to live Google Colab Notebook [**HERE**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m3Gsfx8VUI4z3Z7ry1aZTAwq6HGo5XR8?usp=sharing). The Dashboard is hosted [**HERE**](https://fx-currency-imbalance.onrender.com/).

**Graphic Objective:**
I wanted to explore alternative visualisation techniques for plotting multivariate time-series data, specifically to move beyond always having time dimension on X-axis. I also wanted to experiment with darker themes.

**Business Objective:**
Dashboard connects to FRED API through ```pandas-datareader``` and to Bank of England Database through ```requests``` library to fetch data. The dashboard plots monthly Money Supply (total money in circulation) inhe  US and UK and overlays it over daily FX rate. Dashboard also calculates correlation matrix. (Note: I suggest using Monthly weighted exchange rate, instead of Daily/End-of-Month rate to accurately capture corr between Money Base and FX)

**Business Logic:**
I kinda thought about FX exchange rate as a ratio between growth rates of money supplies:
- If Money Supply of USD increases, while Money Supply of GBP stays the same - Dollar depreciates
- If Money Supply of USD decrease, while Money Supply of GNP stays the same - Dollar appreciates
